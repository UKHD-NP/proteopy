    *9 February 2026*

    We are thrilled to announce the first public release of ProteoPy! Our goal is
    to make proteomics data analysis accessible to everyone — whether you are a
    seasoned bioinformatician or a bench scientist exploring your data for the
    first time. We hope ProteoPy helps you get from raw results to biological
    insight with minimal friction.

    See the :doc:`installation </installation>` guides and :doc:`tutorials </tutorials/index>` to get started.
